Basic PHP Syntax
A PHP script can be placed anywhere in the document.

A PHP script starts with <?php //and ends with ?>:

<?php
// PHP code goes here
?>

Note: PHP statements end with a semicolon (;).

PHP Case Sensitivity
In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, 
and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.

In the example below, all three echo statements below are equal and legal:
-->

<?php
ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<br>";

?>
